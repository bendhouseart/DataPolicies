# Licenses 

This document summarizes some of the available licenses for [copywritable works](#creative-commons-license), licenses for [source code](#code-licenses), as well as licenses created specifically to deal with the [publishing and sharing of data](#data-licenses). 

Note this does not apply to subjects related brain imaging data originating from the European Union. Group level derived data (agregated values, images, etc) can however be licensed that way (see public sector directive https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directive_on_the_re-use_of_public_sector_information#Open_data_licensing). For subjects related brain imaging data originating from the European Union, datasets must be shared using a Data Use agreement (e.g. https://open-brain-consent.readthedocs.io/en/stable/gdpr/data_user_agreement.html) and, if shared outside the EU, users must additionally sign the [EU standard contractual clauses](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/standard-contractual-clauses-scc/standard-contractual-clauses-international-transfers_en).

## Creative Commons Licenses

In it's most condensed form Creative Common Licenses can be seen at this [wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Commons_license#Types_of_license)

Licenses are delinated by the number of "baseline rights" that they grant, those being:

- Attribution or **BY**
- Share-alike or **SA**
- Non-commercial or  **NC**
- No Derivative works or **ND**

Licenses are listed in order of least restrictive to most restrictive, with
CC0 having 0 additional attachements and Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives (BY-NC-ND) being the most restrictive.

The matrix[1] below summarizes them very nicely if you don't wish to read further:

The brief summaries and license deeds were collected from [2] and are aggregated below.

### CC Brief summaries

- [CC0](#cc0) no rights reserved

- [CC BY](#cc-by) This license lets others distribute, remix, adapt, and build upon your work, even commercially, as long as they credit you for the original creation. This is the most accommodating of licenses offered. Recommended for maximum dissemination and use of licensed materials.

- [CC BY-SA](#cc-by-sa) This license lets others remix, adapt, and build upon your work even for commercial purposes, as long as they credit you and license their new creations under the identical terms. This license is often compared to “copyleft” free and open source software licenses. All new works based on yours will carry the same license, so any derivatives will also allow commercial use. This is the license used by Wikipedia, and is recommended for materials that would benefit from incorporating content from Wikipedia and similarly licensed projects.

- [CC BY-ND](cc-by-nd) This license lets others reuse the work for any purpose, including commercially; however, it cannot be shared with others in adapted form, and credit must be provided to you. 

- [CC BY-NC](cc-by-nc) This license lets others remix, adapt, and build upon your work non-commercially, and although their new works must also acknowledge you and be non-commercial, they don’t have to license their derivative works on the same terms.

- [CC BY-NC-SA](cc-by-nc-sa) This license lets others remix, adapt, and build upon your work non-commercially, as long as they credit you and license their new creations under the identical terms.

- [CC BY-NC-ND](cc-by-nc-nd) This license is the most restrictive of the six main licenses, only allowing others to download your works and share them with others as long as they credit you, but they can’t change them in any way or use them commercially.
